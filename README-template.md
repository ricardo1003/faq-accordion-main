## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned some methods of making widgets and those kinds of stuff

### Continued development

I just realized this said "Hide/show when it's clicked" and "Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone", when I only put a :hover pseudo-class.
I should learn more about that (and read this first before starting)
